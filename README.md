# A Simple Blockchain Explorer

This was the first application I built using react, whilst learning how to build a simple blockchain.

- The result, was a simple blockchain explorer.

Latest Update: August 2018 (Incomplete)
Description: Giving this app a rework!

Using: React, Redux, Webpack, and LevelDB for a file-based storage for the blockchain.
